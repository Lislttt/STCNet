## Description

STCNet is a lightweight detection model for steel continuous casting billet surface defects. It combines a star-operation backbone, convolutional additive self-attention, and adaptive cross-scale fusion to enhance feature learning while maintaining efficiency. Evaluated on the SCCB-SDD and GC10-DET datasets, STCNet achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost, outperforming mainstream methods with only 7.1M parameters and 15.6 GFLOPs. This repository provides model[https://github.com/Lislttt/STCNet/blob/main/Model.py] and checkpoints[https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive] to reproduce proposed method.
