## Description

STCNet is a lightweight real-time object detection model designed for edge devices and resource-constrained environments. It combines the efficient StarNet backbone with advanced cross-scale feature enhancement and adaptive feature fusion techniques, achieving a strong balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. This repository provides model and checkpoints (named by the dataset) to reproduce proposed method.

Key Features

Lightweight Backbone: Efficient star operation for compact yet powerful feature extraction

Cross-Scale Feature Enhancement: Channel-Aware Feature Enhancement (CAFE) modules

Adaptive Feature Fusion: AFFM, AMFB, and CMFF for multi-scale feature integration

Real-Time Ready: Optimized for fast inference on edge devices

Balanced Performance: High accuracy with reduced parameters and FLOPs
